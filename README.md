# TRUHiC
## Introduction
TRUHiC is a Hi-C data resolution enhancement method that integrates a customized and lightweight transformer architecture embedded into a U-2 Net architecture to augment low-resolution Hi-C data for the characterization of 3D chromatin structure. 

This repository contains codes and processed files for the manuscript entitled *"TRUHiC: A TRansformer-embedded U-2 Net to enhance Hi-C data for 3D chromatin structure characterization."*. (link to be added)


## Getting started
Codes for the main experimental analysis are provided in the <code>Models.zip</code> and <code>Experiments</code>folder with instructions included in a readme file inside. All required input files for a demo can be found in the <code><b>Data</b></code> folder zipped and can be extracted using the 7zip tool.   

### Installation
TRUHiC can be downloaded by
```
git clone https://github.com/shilab/TRUHiC
```

### Prerequisites:
Python >= 3.7.3  
Jupyterlab >= 4.2.3

Install required dependencies 
```
pip3 install pandas==1.2.4 numpy==1.20.2 scipy==1.7.3 matplotlib==3.5.3 statsmodels==0.13.5 seaborn==0.11.1 scikit_posthocs==0.8.1 jupyterlab
```

Ensure that the virtual environment meets the following dependencies:  
Pandas 1.2.x, Numpy 1.20.x, SciPy 1.7.x, Matplotlib 3.5.x, statsmodels 0.13.x, seaborn 0.11.x, scikit_posthocs 0.8.x. 

Users can download the project repository and start the jupyter lab to experiment with the analysis
```
git clone https://github.com/shilab/TRUHiC.git
cd TRUHiC
unzip Models.zip
```

At this point, the main script (TRUHiC_main.py) and command line examples (sbatch-tensorflow.job) will be available to run the model and do evaulation on the demo data.

The <code><b>Data</code></b> folder contains the necessary datasets that are needed for running the main analyses included in our study. A *README* file for the detailed description of each file can be found under the data folder.

Please note that the scripts are specifically designed and organized for this study publication. All the input files and formats are specified in the scripts. Users are welcome to download and run the provided scripts on their own machines to replicate our results. It is possible that the programs may not run on the user's device due to environmental differences or bugs. Therefore, to use the scripts with the user's own data, please consider this repository as an experimental notebook and update the respective directory paths and input files accordingly.
